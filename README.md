
# ðŸŽ­ Face Liveness Detection (Anti-Spoofing) Web App

**Defend your system from impostors!** This web app smartly discerns whether a face belongs to a living person or a mere replica, ensuring your verifications are always genuine and secure.

## ðŸš€ Why We Built This

In a world where digital security is paramount, simple face recognition isn't enough. Inspired by [this awesome project](https://github.com/jomariya23156/face-recognition-with-liveness-web-login), we've taken it a step further with advanced liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks.
